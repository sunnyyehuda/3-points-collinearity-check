# 3-points-collinearity-check
This program check if the 3 3d points are collinear or not.
Given 3 points from the user, construct 2 vector and calculate their cross product.
If the output is equal to 0, then the area of the parallelogram constructed from these vector is 0 (which tells that the vectors are at the same direction).
